										<p>
										  My name is Natalie N. Soto López, I am currently in my last year of my bachelor's degree in Environmental Microbiology. 
										  This focuses on microorganisms associated with the environment and their possible effects on ecosystems, 
										  humans and even animals. My research interests include everything that can improve or help our environment. 
										  However, I am more inclined to research where I work and help with the conservation of endangered animals.

										  My name is Kiara S. Mercado Ortiz, soon to be graduate student at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo with a B.S. in Microbiology in Environmental 
										  Concentration. I spent a year researching the Puerto Rican boa and its relationship with Ophidiomyces ophidiicola.
										  I never thought of working with snakes, but being part of this research I recognize the importance of studying them to provide more scientifically 
										  based information.

										  My name is Taimar E. Velez Roman, I belong to the Bachelor of Biology with a concentration in Medical Microbiology and 
										  I am a student of the research focused on the isolation of environmental DNA of Ophidiomyces ophidiicola, 
										  being one of the pathogens that cause fungal diseases in snakes. Throughout the year that I have been part of this project, 
										  my interest in continuing research has grown, I have been able to learn and apply techniques that I did not know; above 
										  all I have learned how important it is to provide scientific information to help recognize the importance of each species, such as the Puerto Rican Boa, in the ecosystem.

									  <p>
										Dr. Gualberto Rosado Rodríguez 
										PhD in Marine Sciences - Biological Oceanography 
										Assistant Professor, UPRA 
										Head of the Biology Department 
										Areas of Interest: Environmental Mycology, Surveillance of Wildlife Fungal Diseases, Molecular Biology 
										PI of the PR Surveillance Program for Pathogenic Fungi of Reptiles
										
										My line of work focuses on environmental mycology, where the emphasis has been on the study of fungi associated with animals. My previous work includes studies on the diversity of fungi associated with leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) nests in Puerto Rico and the isolation and characterization of fungi associated with marine sponges. These areas are relevant for monitoring emerging pathogenic organisms that may affect protected species. I am also the Co-PI for the Pilot Study for the Isolation and Molecular Characterization of Ophidiomyces ophidiicola from Cave Habitats in Puerto Rico.
					
										Recent research efforts include fungal disease surveillance in leatherback sea turtles and freshwater turtles of the genus Trachemys. 
					
										I teach courses in Environmental Mycology, Molecular Biology, Biotechnology, and Microbiology. Also, I direct undergraduate student research in the area of Environmental Mycology.
